# Exam Project
The aim of the project is to create an external interface for the marketplace of the text-based game Torn (https://www.torn.com/).
  
The API is available at https://api.torn.com/. Some features require an API key available for egistered accounts, but a sample key is provided with the project.
  
The API is very suitable for GD project since it is an actual well used API of a web-based MMO. The API is free to use for all players and provides a good start for programming game-based tools.
  
Introduction of the API on Torn's official wiki:
> The goal of the Torn API is to provide a fully supported and read-only method for players to pull useful information from Torn about their player, faction, or company. This can be used individually to retrieve information about your account, or you can build a website that the entire community can use to do interesting things with the data exposed via the API.

# Project details
* Sometimes the Torn API is down, especially during June 2023 as they are migrating their services. The tool will give a warning if this is the case.  
* As the provided API key should not be public knowledge, it will be automatically disabled in a couple of weeks. 
* Ranked wars are scheduled every Tuesday at noon and happen during weekends, so on Mondays and Tuesday mornings the list might be empty.
  

# Switching repositories
A local sample data is provided as a replacement for the API. This data can activated by clicking on the Skip-button on the Set API Key -screen.
